# Introduction
In this project focused on the city of Madrid, I will explore various key aspects including population, immigration and emigration movements, birth and death statistics, unemployment rates, and the most common names among residents. To conduct this analysis, I will use data provided by the Banco de Datos del Ayuntamiento de Madrid, a reliable and comprehensive source.

This portal contains a wide range of datasets on demographics, economy, education, health, and other relevant aspects of life in the city of Madrid, providing a solid foundation for my research.

# Loading Data
To begin, we'll need to load necessary libraries and import the datasets.

``` r
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(scales)
library(wordcloud)
library(visNetwork)
library(networkD3)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)


# Change text
library(showtext)
font_add_google("Oswald")
showtext_auto()

# Read the data 
population <- read.csv("../input/population.csv", sep=",", fileEncoding="UTF-8")
immigrants_emigrants_by_sex <- read.csv("../input/immigrants_emigrants_by_sex.csv", sep=",", fileEncoding="UTF-8")
immigrants_emigrants_by_age <- read.csv("../input/immigrants_emigrants_by_age.csv", sep=",", fileEncoding="UTF-8")
immigrants_emigrants_by_destination <- read.csv("../input/immigrants_emigrants_by_destination.csv", sep=",", fileEncoding="UTF-8")
immigrants_emigrants_by_destination2 <- read.csv("../input/immigrants_emigrants_by_destination2.csv", sep=",", fileEncoding="UTF-8")
immigrants_by_nationality <- read.csv("../input/immigrants_by_nationality.csv", sep=",", fileEncoding="UTF-8")
births <- read.csv("../input/births.csv", sep=",", fileEncoding="UTF-8")
deaths <- read.csv("../input/deaths.csv", sep=",", fileEncoding="UTF-8")
unemployment <- read.csv("../input/unemployment.csv", sep=",", fileEncoding="UTF-8")
baby_names <- read.csv("../input/most_frequent_baby_names.csv", sep=",")
names <- read.csv("../input/most_frequent_names.csv", sep=",")

```
# Data Analysis
Population

```r
# Population by year 

population$date <- ordered(population$date, levels=c(2018,2019,2020,2021,2022,2023))
population %>%
  group_by(date, Gender) %>%
  summarise(count=sum(Number)) %>%
  mutate(percent=paste0(round((count/sum(count))*100, 2), "%")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=count)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", aes(fill=Gender)) +
  geom_text(aes(label=percent, group=Gender), position=position_stack(vjust=0.5), size = 3) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#91C8E4", "#FFABAB"), name = "Gender") +
  labs(x="Year", y="Population", title="Population by year (2018-2023)") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#f6f0ec", color = NA)
  ) +
  theme(
    panel.border = element_blank(), 
    panel.grid = element_blank(), 
    axis.line = element_line(color = "#f6f0ec"), 
    text = element_text(family = "Oswald", size = 15, color = "black") 
  )
```
